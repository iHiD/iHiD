### Hi there üëã

I'm Jeremy _(he/him)_ - a social entrepeneur and software developer (üë®‚Äçüíª). Online I go by [iHiD](https://twitter.com/iHiD).

You probably know me as the **co-founder of [Exercism](https://exercism.io)** - an online platform that helps people upskill their programming skills through practice and mentoring. We're a open-source organisation with **over 200 GitHub repositories**, thousands of contributors, and a friendly, inclusive community. We've had over 500k people use us and millions of submssions. We're always looking for new people to help - [email me](mailto:hello@exercism.io) if you'd like to get involved üôÇ

You might also know me as the **co-founder of [Kaido](https://kaido.org)** - a health and wellbeing startup helping companies take better care of their employees. We work with companies who are tiny (4 people), huge multinationals (e.g. HSBC and KPMG), charities (e.g. Refugee Action) and with the NHS - the UK's public health service. Try Kaido for free and see how we can help your workplace be a happier and healthier place! üôÇ

I also run [Thalamus](https://thalamus.ai). I previously co-founded [Reachora](https://rutherfordmedicine.com) _(2016-2019)_ and [Meducation](https://meducation.net) _(2008-2016)_. I've also been a founding member of [Flaunt](https://flauntreport.com) and [GetStoic](https://getstoic.co), and ran two software consultancies (_Meridian Innovations_ and _Pure Intellect_). 

From 2016-2019 I was a Non-exec Director at the wonderful [Beatfreeks](https://beatfreeks.com/).

### Bio

I spend my time building organisations and businesses that help others. My core skillset involves strategy, leadership, community building, and software development. I have a degree in Artificial Intelligence and have co-developed a [deep-learning algorithm used in Interventional Cardiology](https://patentscope2.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2019122919&tab=PCTBIBLIO). 

Day-to-day, I'm normally coding, leading, strategising or thinking - whichever is the most important at any given time!

Away from work I read, travel, climb, and get nerdy about coffee.
